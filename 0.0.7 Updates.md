Update 0.0.7:

UI updates:

- Various fixes to light and dark mode, as well as adding functionality for more customizable light-theme (Settings).
- Profile based theme defaults.
- Additional unification and cohesion updates for elements between pages.
- AI status should adequately track AI connectivity (better then before anyways).
- Too many other small things to count.

Flag Forge:

- Added an authoritative database of known Emerald flags from the PRET Pokeemerald decomplication; credit to those brainiacs!

  WIP: Categorization for flags (somewhat implemented)

Script Sage:

- Better LLM prompting for HMA scripting advice.

Trainer Architect:

- Generation is vastly improved.
- Complete Pokedex integration from reputable sources like Serebii and Bulbapedia. This includes Pokémon, movesets, level-up learnsets, sprites, abilities, and stats.
- Custom 'biome' filtering for the generation of teams using the tool. Biome selection will yield teams more fitting of the terrain the trainer is located in.
- Trainer architype will also play a role in the generation; Youngsters prefer weaker, un-evolved Pokémon whereas Ace Trainers will be more likely to have evolved Pokémon.
- Generation fail safes to handle de-evolution of a fully evolved Pokémon when the level requirements are not met. (this is still WIP)

Sprite Studio:

- Shelved, brain hurty.

Narrative Engine:

- A document parser for working story threads from external files/notes created outside the environment. (still also a WIP)

Bug Catcher:

- Better logging. Added an undo button for previously changed items.

Settings Integration:

- Functional Settings button with user management, theme customization, and other features.
- User based project folders implemented. Generated content will be associated with the user and project for more seamless profile changing.

As always, report those pesky bugs.
Enjoy EMERALDMIND-0.0.7!
